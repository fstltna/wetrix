---------------------------------

(1)	MACHINE REQUIREMENTS

The minimum specification to run Wetrix is as follows

Windows 95/98
Pentium 90 
16 Mbytes RAM 
CD Drive (Double Speed Minimum) 
Direct X 5 or higher
15 MB Hard Drive Space (compact installation)

Recommended

Pentium 166 or higher
32 Mbytes RAM or higher
Microsoft Compatible Mouse

32 MB Hard Drive Space (typical installation)



(2) 	INSTALLATION

(i) Autorun
If the autorun option is active on your machine, simply inserting the Wetrix CD will start the installation program running.  If the installation program does not automatically start, it can be manually run by opening the CD and running the file named 'Setup'.



(3) 	DIRECT X

(i)	Installing Direct X
In order for Wetrix to run with Windows 95, the user must have Direct X 5 or higher installed on their machine.  Direct X is not automatically installed with Wetrix, but it is contained on the CD (if an error message saying that the DDRAW.DLL file cannot be found is displayed when you try and start Wetrix, it means Direct X is not installed).
To install Direct X, explore the CD (achieved by clicking on the CD icon within My Computer with button 2 of the mouse), enter the 'directx' directory and run the 'dxsetup' program.  From here the 'Reinstall DirectX' option should be selected.  Please note, after Direct X has installed, Windows will need to be restarted so users are advised to close all other programs before beginning installation or data may be lost.

(ii)	Windows 98 
Windows 98 comes with its own version of Direct X pre-installed.  Users playing the game on a machine with Windows 98 as their operating system do not need to install Direct X from the Wetrix CD.

(iii)	Powerdesk Utilities etc. 
When Direct X is installed, it will often remove any powerdesk utilities that the video card may have been using (eg. with the Matrox Millennium video card the Matrox Powerdesk will be removed).  This is a feature of DirectX and should not cause any problems with the configuration or operation of the machine.

If you encounter any problems installing DirectX on your computer, please contact Microsoft directly.



(4)	VIDEO PROBLEMS

(i)	Running Wetrix in a Window 
If running the game in a window, it is recommended that the Windows desktop have a colour setting of 16 bit colour or higher.  Running the game in a Window with a colour setting of 256 colours will result in an incorrect colour palette.

(ii) 	Problems running game in 320*240 full screen mode
If any problems are encountered when trying to run the game in '320*240' fullscreen mode, the user is advised to run the game in '640*480 scaled' (which will run the game in the same 320*240 resolution but was found to be more stable during testing). 

(iii) Video Card Drivers
If any graphical problems are encountered, users are advised to obtain the latest drivers for their video card (eg. one set of drivers for ATI Rage II based video cards was found to cause problems in 320*240 full screen mode, obtaining the latest drivers fixed the problem).



(5)  	WINDOWS CONFIGURATION

(i)   Virtual Desktops
If Windows is configured with a Virtual Desktop, the user is advised to
deactivate it before running Wetrix as the Windows screen resolution may change to that of the Desktop upon exiting.

(ii)	Active Desktop
If the game is being played on a machine with the Active Desktop function of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4, upon exiting it may be found that the Windows taskbar has moved up the screen slightly.  This problem can be rectified by simply dragging the taskbar back down to its previous setting using the mouse.

(iii) Mouse Cursor
When playing Wetrix, the user is advised to have the Windows mouse cursor set to default and without pointer trails active.  To check this, open the START menu from the Windows taskbar and select the 'Control Panel' icon from the 'Settings' menu.  Next open the 'Mouse' option from the Control Panel and a Window titled 'Mouse Properties' should be opened.  To change the cursor to default, click on the 'Pointers' tab and for the 'Normal Select' option displayed on this screen, click on the 'Use Default' icon at the bottom of the screen (if this icon cannot be selected then the default mouse cursor is already being used).  To turn pointer trails off, click on the 'Motion' tab of the 'mouse Properties' window, here there will be a box marked 'Show Pointer Trails', ensure that this box is not ticked.

(iv) Minimising Wetrix
If Wetrix needs to be minimised, the user is advised not to use ALT/TAB to minimise the game whilst it is being played in full screen mode.  If the Windows desktop needs to be accessed, we advise changing the games view to 320*240 windowed mode.



(6)	CD ROM DRIVES

(i) 	Multi CD ROM drives
When installing the game on a machine with a multi CDROM drive 
(ie. one that is capable of holding more than one CD), users are 
advised that they should place the Wetrix CD in the first tray.  
If the CD is placed in any other tray, the game will play correctly 
but there will be no CD music.



(7)   UNINSTALLATION

(i) Uninstalling Wetrix
To uninstall Wetrix, the user needs to open the 'Add/Remove programs' window (found in the 'Control Panel' which can be accessed from the 'Settings' option on the START menu).  Once this is done the 'Add/Remove Programs Properties' window should open.  Ensure the 'Install/Uninstall' tab is open, highlight the 'Wetrix for Windows 95' option and click on the 'Add/Remove' button.



(8)	TROUBLESHOOTING

If there are any problems running the game, there are a few things the user can try to solve the problem.

(i)   Install Direct X separately.  
Direct X can be manually be installed by the user.  This is done by exploring the CD (achieved by clicking on the CD icon within My Computer with button 2 of the mouse), entering the 'directx' directory and running the 'dxsetup' program.  From here the 'Reinstall DirectX' option should be selected. 

(ii) Check that all Direct X drivers are Certified
To check the drivers are certified, the user should first run the 'dxsetup' program from the Wetrix CD (instructions on how to do so are given above).  Once this is done a list of 'Components' will appear on screen.  In order for most current software to run correctly, the 'Primary Display Driver' and the 'Primary Sound Driver' should both have the word 'Certified' to the right of them.  If this is not the case, either try manually installing Direct X, or obtain the latest Windows drivers for your video/sound card from your hardware manufacturer.

(iii)  Reinstall game
Sometimes, problems can be solved by simply uninstalling Wetrix and then reinstalling it again.

(iv)	Ensure no other programs are running  
Close all other applications before running Wetrix.
